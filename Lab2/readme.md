## Executive Summary 
This lab focuses on individual hardware components as well as data representation.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
Hard drives are the primary storage unit in a computer, and are made of spinning discs and a reading arm to read and write data. Memory is a computer's method of storing quick access data for programs and general usage, and is often much faster than static storage. 
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the time it takes the reading arm to reach the data on the rotating disks, and transfer rate is how fast the data gets read and written.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Hard drives are mechanical components that take time to read and write, while solid state drives use flash memory and have no moving parts but are generally much faster yet more expensive.
#### Random Access Memory
RAM is used by the CPU to quickly transfer data pertaining to running programs, and things such as copy and pasting. However it is volatile and requires power to run, as such it cannot be used for storage.
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU is the part of the CPU that does calculations, while the control unit is the part that tells the cpu what to do.
### CPU, Input & Output
The CPU is what carries out most of a computer's calculations, it has an input and an output sector.
### Logic Gates 
Logic gates take one or more inputs to output something different in a specific way.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is an association formed in 1884 meant to help professional engineers in innovation and invention.
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal is the most basic and well known representation consisting of the 10 digits from 0-9. Binary only uses 1s and 0s, and hexadecimal uses letters to have a total of 16 characters. These are all methods of representing data in a computer-legible way.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Every color can be represented in hexadecimal, and can be seen by using a color picker on the internet.
## Conclusion
To conclude, a computer has many important components which can be individually described. Data can be represented in many different ways that can be understood by computers.
