## Executive Summary 
Todays lab will cover internet architecture, webpage coding, and URLs.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP Address is a string of characters assigned to any device connected to the internet as a form of identification. IPv4 uses a 32-bit number split into 4 segments, while IPv6 uses a combinatino of numbers and characters to make a 128-bit length string, which gives it a lot more possible values to be distributed.
#### ICANN
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is an American NGO tasked with distributing and allocating IP addresses, which makes them arguably one of the most important organizations for the internet to function. 
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP is tasked with connecting different devices via IP addresses on the internet. 
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
It works by opening 'ports' between different IP addresses to communicate data, with it traveling to the server as an intermediary before reaching the recieving client.
#### Layers
Layers are important in protocol because it allows individual changes in the system to be made without affecting the whole system.
#### Application Layer
Some applications that run on the application layer are things like HTTP (webpages), and email systems (SMTP, POP3).
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is a protocol that lets devices communicate with servers and displaying webpages. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
SSL and TSL are protocols used for HTTPS that work by presenting security certificates which authorizes them to communicate with devices, and encrypts data being sent back and forth so it cannot be intercepted as it is traveling. 
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
It's important to secure your browser because some websites are malicious and may install spyware/malware or even steal your data without you noticing.
### Risk Explained
Some of the included risks are things like installed softwares coming with bloatware that could be hazardous to your computer, or the fact that people don't pay attention to links before clicking on them, which can lead them to a potentially dangerous website without them noticing.
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the World Wide Web. He created W3C to uphold standards for the world wide web.
Web of Devices is a standard that looks after enabling web access anywhere at anytime. In this day and age this is probably the most important standard to uphold.
### HTML5 and CSS
HTML uses simple elements and their start/end tags to tell a browser how to display a webpage. For example the heading and paragraph tags. CSS uses some simple elements and attributes to style and format an HTML page, which can be sourced externally, internally, or written in-line with the HTML code. Some of the tags I used were that for background color, border, and text color.
### HTML and XML
XML, unlike HTML, does not have any predefined tags, and instead each tag is created by the author of the XML file. Instead of displaying data like HTML, XML only carries data.
## Components of a URL
Scheme: https, or http
domain: the name of the website
top level domain: .edu; gives general information on website
default page: www.amazon.com; usually the homepage or index page that leads to other parts of the website
parameters: result of search; usually gives a specific webpage
anchors: specific location on a page; as in scrolled down to a certain point in a webpage.
## Conclusion
Today we discussed the overall architecture of the internet including protocols and how they function, how webpages work with HTML and CSS, and what makes up a URL.
