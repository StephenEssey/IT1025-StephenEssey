## Executive Summary
Hello! My name is Stephen, I'm from Parma. I'm a high school graduate doing my second semester of college and I'm still trying to figure things out. I do a small part-time job at a hockey rink. I guess two interesting things about me are that I love parrots and video games. I want to major in computer science so I'm taking this course as a sort of prerequisite.
