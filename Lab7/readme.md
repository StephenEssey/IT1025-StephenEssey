## Executive Summary 
Today's lab will focus on file compression, object oriented programming and concepts, as well as UML.

## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
File comrpession is used to store multiple files in a single, openable file, which also greatly reduces file size. In order to access compressed files, they must be unpacked.
### Compression and File Size
The original file size of .svg file is 58.3KB. After  compressing, it is 34.5KB, or 60% the original size. I would expect a JPG file of the same image to be slightly larger in size due to the fact that JPG files are made of pixels rather than vectors, which take up more space.
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The attributes of the shark class are methods that can be called using parentheses
### Methods:
The methods are functions defined inside a class, which in this case are swim() and be_awesome().
### Constructor:
A constructor is a method that automatically initializes upon instantiation of a class, without needing to be called upon prior.
### Class vs. Object
If an object is any entity pertaining to a program, a class is it's blueprint. A class defines attributes and rules for for any object instantiated from said class. Instantiating an object from a class just means defining and calling one.
## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
Instantiated objcets are objects created under a class.
### Inheritance
Inheritance in an Object-Oriented Program is the ability for a class to to have children, or derived classes that inherit all attributes from a parent, or base class.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation works to bind data together and conceal it from the outside, while abstraction defines the behavior of an object in real life. The shark class works by first creating objects within it's own confines and then using methods to ouput or contain object behaviors.
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
To conclude, we learned about basic file compression, as well as some basic object-oriented programming and concepts in the form of shark classes.
