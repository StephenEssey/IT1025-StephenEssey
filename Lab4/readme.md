## Executive Summary 
Today's Lab will focus on CMD, Python and graphics.

## Python IDLE
The shell is a simple command line tool that lets you write and test simple programs, while the editor let's you write complicated and lengthy pieces of code.
## Code Examples
### Variable: A variable is a stored value in coding, such as a number. In the video provided, the author uses the example of Spam Bacon and Eggs because it is from a monty python sketch, which is where python got it's name from.
### Assignment statement: An assignment statement is the act of assigning a variable, for example, x = 9. 
### Function: A function is a set of code that can be reused for a particular task.
### Three data types:
The three data types are integers, which are, well, integers (-1, 0, 1, 2 etc...). Strings, which are variables composed of characters including letters and numbers. And lastly, floats, which are any number that includes a decimal point (-1.09, 0.0, 27.889 etc...).
## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
The main difference between Raster and Vector graphics is the fact that raster graphics uses pixels and loses quality the more you zoom in, whilst vector graphics are composed of mathematical shapes and as such do not lose quality no matter how far you zoom in. Raster graphics can be used for most typical things like image sharing, while raster graphics are useful for things like logos which are often scaled up and down for the purpose of graphic design.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless images retain all the data of the original file, while lossy compression removes some data to reduce file size. Lossless images can be important to use when high quality is needed, such as when designing a webpage, but lossy compression can be much more efficient when the use is of less importance, such as sharing simple screenshots or photos.
### File Formats
JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), is one of the earliest photo types that is still used today, it compresses images into bigger blocks of pixels to reduce file size while trying to retain quality. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), is a rather limited file type as it can only use 8-bit color, or 256 colors total. It's not lossy however when colors need to be converted to those within the 256 limit a lot of quality is lost. It can also be used for animated images. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) supports both 8-bit and 24-bit color, while also supporting transparency and having a more efficient and lossless compression method. PNGs, however, are most often rather large in file size.
### File Properties
My logo was honestly really simple and I though it didn't need more. I used a total of 2 layers, A simple spherical background with a border and a letter 'T' on the inside.
The logo is 58.3KB, the default application windows wants to open it with is Microsoft Edge (ugh). A more appropriate program for it would be something like Adobe Illustrator however I don't currently have it.
## Conclusion
To conclude, we learned about the basics of cmd, made a directory and navigated to it. We learned some basics of python coding, and made a simple hello program. Lastly we learned about graphics and all the different file types and what each is useful for.
