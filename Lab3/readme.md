## Executive Summary 
Today's lab will discuss softwares, virtualizations, python code, and career exploration within the context of computing and information technology.

## Software
### Types of Software
Application software is software that is used for specific things, for example, text-editting softwares like microsoft word, or any video game applications. Utility softwares are used to maintain a computer. One such example is an anti-virus application or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software. Some operating systems have a lot of these built-in, such as windows' built-in anti-virus program Windows Defender. Operating Systems do not usually have a fully functioning user interface and more of an internal program that helps the computer run and interact with it's hardware.
### ERP
ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning software, is used in large scale database usage such as in companies for ease of access and function within said company. An ERP usually has one central database that links up everything, and that everyone has access to. One example is Microsoft's ERP, Microsoft Dynamics.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization helps make more use of hardware, or increasing efficiency, as well as potentially lowering overall cooling and maintenance costs by using less hardware for the same number of tasks.
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors serve as an intermediate between hardware and virtualization. They take the available hardware and process it for virtual environments.
### Option A: Compare and Contrast Virtualization (delete if selection option B)
At the most basic level, virtualization is a technology that uses a given set of hardware to create an environment, while cloud computing is an environment in and of itself, which runs off of a bare operating system, with something such as linux. Virtualization generally has a much longer lifespan than cloud computing. 
Migrating from virtualization to cloud is not a simple process and can be limited within companies due to license agreements between enterprises, however, if it can be done, all virtual resources should be collected, and managed using specific software to then move on to cloud. 

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Python is said to have a pseudo-code nature because of it's simplicity and resemblence to the regular english language. It makes it incredibly easy to understand and write in comparison to other coding languages which could get complicated, convoluted, and hard to understand at first. 
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language, such as C or C++ is one that needs to be compiled from the language itself into one that can be understood by a computer, such as binary, before it can be run. An interpreted language, such as python, does not have to be 'converted' and can be ran straight from the source code, which gets fed information to the computer internally using it's own technology.
## Career Exploration
### College Central
From what I've looked through so far, the website seems to have a great system of listing job and intern offers, and it's definitely something I will be using in the future.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
There are many career options relating to IT that I found listed on the site, including computer and informatino research scientists, computer network architects, computer programmers and more. I seem to be most interested in being a computer programmer. Even with just a bachelor's degree the median pay is over 85,000$ which I think is astounding.
### Certifications
### Certificates and Degrees
I think I would be most interested in Cisco's certificate as the other two both involve cyber security which I have no interest in. 
### Co-ops / Internships
To be 'co-op ready' I would have to go through Tri-C's orientation process, upload a resume, work with an employer relations specialist, and then sign an education agreemant to register for credits. It's important because it provides the opportunity to look deeper into my interests with work experience.
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
The IEEE is an organization dedicated to "advancing technology for the benefit of humanity". They help publish works such as journals and magazines and host conferences. They are based all over the world, half of their members are outside of the United States.
## Conclusion
To conclude, this lab went over a wide range of topics, including softwares, virtualization, coding in the form of python, and lastly career exploration.
