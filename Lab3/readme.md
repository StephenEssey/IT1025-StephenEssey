## Executive Summary 
Today's lab will discuss softwares, virtualizations, python code, and career exploration within the context of computing and information technology.

## Software
### Types of Software
Application software is software that is used for specific things, for example, text-editting softwares like microsoft word, or any video game applications. Utility softwares are used to maintain a computer. One such example is an anti-virus application or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software. Some operating systems have a lot of these built-in, such as windows' built-in anti-virus program Windows Defender. Operating Systems do not usually have a fully functioning user interface and more of an internal program that helps the computer run and interact with it's hardware.
### ERP
ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning software, is used in large scale database usage such as in companies for ease of access and function within said company. An ERP usually has one central database that links up everything, and that everyone has access to. One example is Microsoft's ERP, Microsoft Dynamics.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization helps make more use of hardware, or increasing efficiency, as well as potentially lowering overall cooling and maintenance costs by using less hardware for the same number of tasks.
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors serve as an intermediate between hardware and virtualization. They take the available hardware and process it for virtual environments.
### Option A: Compare and Contrast Virtualization (delete if selection option B)
At the most basic level, virtualization is a technology that uses a given set of hardware to create an environment, while cloud computing is an environment in and of itself, which runs off of a bare operating system, with something such as linux. Virtualization generally has a much longer lifespan than cloud computing. 
Migrating from virtualization to cloud is not a simple process and can be limited within companies due to license agreements between enterprises, however, if it can be done, all virtual resources should be collected, and managed using specific software to then move on to cloud. 

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Python is said to have a pseudo-code nature because of it's simplicity and resemblence to the regular english language. It makes it incredibly easy to understand and write in comparison to other coding languages which could get complicated, convoluted, and hard to understand at first. 
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language, such as C or C++ is one that needs to be compiled from the language itself into one that can be understood by a computer, such as binary, before it can be run. An interpreted language, such as python, does not have to be 'converted' and can be ran straight from the source code, which gets fed information to the computer internally using it's own technology.
