## Executive Summary 
Today's lab will discuss data and information, SQL, and Ethics.
## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data is the most basic form of storage, it lacks any sort of context or meaning and is just the simple facts. Information is data with it's given context, for example, data pertaining to a certain topic such as climate change. Knowledge is based on human beliefs of specific information regions, for example the knowledge of how to fly a plane, or how to build a boat.
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be the ID of the customer.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
Data from the orders table would be included in a field for every customer in the customer table.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The foreign key in the orders table would be something like the ID of individual orders or products.
### Field Data Types
It's important to define a data type for each field because it can be quantative or qualatative, and it's important for each to be labeled so they can be processed and analyzed without hassle.
### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume describes the size of data, variety describes the different types of data containing within a collection, velocity describes the flow of data, or the speed at which it is being generated/received. Lastly, variability refers to inconsitencies and discrepencies in data which can prove harmful to data analysis.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Things like stock exchanges and social media are what drives the need for big data processing.
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
An RDBMS or Relational Database Management System is a system where data is stored in such a way that it can be compared to and analyzed with other data; in the form of structured and organized tables made of rows and columns. SQL or Structured Query Language is a coding language used to interact with Relational Databases.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys
"To be completely honest the image shown in onenote is too blurry to see anything, and there is no option to zoom in or open the image. I also can't find the exact table on w3schools. I apologize."
## SQL Injections
SQL Injections use vulnerablilites in input-bars on websites to inject SQL code which can return data which otherwise should not be given, such as usernames and passwords of every person on the website. This is a major threat for web developers and companies. SQL attacks are moore often than not catastrophic in consequences. One way of preventing them is using SQL parameters to ensure what's being run by SQL engines is not injected.
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
A code of ethics is important in a professional environment to ensure human dignity and privacy are not violated. While a code of ethics discusses what is morally right, and does not have much of an impact upon being violated, an AUP (Accepted Use Policy) of a given service requires that it be followed otherwise your access to said service could be terminated. Amazon's AUP prohibits things such as Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive use/intents, and other things like Security Violations, Network Abuse, and E-mail Abuse (https://aws.amazon.com/aup/).
### Intellectual Property
WIPO is an American Organization dedicated to upholding and helping Intellectual Property rights and right-holders. A copyright for any work one creates is obtained upon it's creation, however, to be able to take legal action against someone who would steal the work, you would have to register for an official copyright with the US copyright office. While I don't feel the need to, it could be important to copyright the iamge file I created to prevent it's theft and unfair use by someone else. If my logo became a trademark for a certain good or service, it would serve the purpose of protecting consumers from conterfeits or knock-offs.
### Information Collection
COPPA restricts the distribution and collection of information from children under the age of 13 by requiring websites to ask for the user's age before granting their services. FERPA protects a student's educational records from being distributed, and gives all permissions to the student once they reach the age of 18. HIPAA protects a person's medical records from being distributed by healthcare workers or otherwise without direct consent and permission.
## Conclusion
To conclude, we learned about data, tables and databases, SQL code, and ethics regarding information and intellectual property.
