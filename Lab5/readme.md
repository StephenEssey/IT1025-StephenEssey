## Executive Summary 
Today's lab will cover lucidchart, networking, cybersecurity, and encryption.

## Lucidchart
Lucidchart was extremely easy and intuitive to use and it only took me around 5 minutes to complete the chart. It's definitely something I will be using in the future.
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:
A packet is a unit of data. All data transferred over the internet must first be broken down into smaller parts, which are packets. Every packet sent has the addresses of the sender and receiver as well as a small piece of information from the original message.
#### Packet-Switching:
Packet switching is when packets are sent through the most optimal route via routers.
#### IP Address:
Every computer and other device on the internet has an IP address to identify it, as well as to be able to communicate with other devices.
#### DNS:
DNS servers are what allows devices to communicate by giving out IP addresses to devices that query for them.
#### Protocol:
Protocols are the set of rules that allow devices to communicate.
### Networking Hardware
A switch is much preferred a hub as it allows data to travel to specific destinations instead of being distributed to every device connected to it, like a hub would. Additionally, a switch reduces traffic by the same principle. A router is superior to hubs and switches as it connects different networks via IP addresses and the internet, rather than local and physical connections via MAC addresses.
### Network Topologies

#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure results when a connection breaks at a single point and results a failure and block of data flow in a system. Some topologies that can experience this are star, ring, and bus topologies.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
 An infrastructure topology is dissimilar to a wireless mesh topology in that devices wanting to connect wireless only have one access point, and if it fails, the whole wireless connection goes down. This makes a wireless mesh topology superior because it can still function even if one or more access points fail.
### Network Design
The topology I decided to use was the infrastructure topology. Two laptops are connected via ethernet to a router, which also connects a wireless router. A printer is connected wirelessly to the router.
### NSA/CSS
The NSA collects and processes foreign signals to aid government officials and warfighters to protect our nation.
## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
If you were a part of Amazon's live chat help, firstly the most important part of the triad is availability. Customers would need help instantaneously, and as such you would have to be available every second of your shift. Confidentiality comes second, important information such as shipping address should not be leaked otherwise you risk your customers safety. Probably least vital is information integrity, however it is still important to not misinform  your customers.
#### Authentication
Three examples of authentication in real life are, the door to your house, the password to your phone, and access to your bank account online. For a simple house lock, you can upgrade it to require both a key and a passcode. For a phone, you can require both biometric inputs (such as fingerprint or facial identification) as well as a password. For the bank account, you can have it require both a standard username and password as well as a 2-FA system which requires a phone-app to generate a key.
#### ACL and RBAC
ACL uses separate lists to group users with permission and access to specific things, while RBAC instead gives each user roles which in turn give them permissions which can be handled in mass.
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
A cipher text is the encrypted data which is sent to the reciever along with a public key, the reciever then uses their own private key along with the public key to decode the file/data. 
#### Public Key Cryptography
Public key cryptography is extremely helpful and important as it allows safe communication as private keys are never shared.
### Cryptography
#### Encryption
I typed in the message "crytography is a growing field" and rotated the wheel 3 times clockwise, shifting the letters by a phase of 3. The resulting encrypted message is "etarvqitcrja ku c itqykpi hkgnf".
#### Frequency Fingerprint
Upon typing the sentence "This is a test for my IT class on the topic of encryption and ciphers", the bars rose slightly, with the most prominent letters being i, s, and t. This very closely matches the original english frequency fingerprint. As different languages have different letters and different manners of structuring sentences, their frequency fingerprints are almost definitely much different than that of English.
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher uses a "shift word" that acts as a sort of key to both encrypt and decrypt a message by altering a message's letter shift based on the shift word's numerical form (each letter converted to a number based on it's position in the alphabet).
#### Polyalphabetic Example
The messsage I encrypted was "this is a test for my IT class", with the shift word being "information. The result was "cvoh af b nnhh ocx bq vu wupgb". The resulting fingerprint does not at all align with the expected.
#### Brute-Force
Kerckhoffs' principle states that a cipher will remain secure regardless if the reciever knows how the cipher works, but does not have the ciphertext. Brute-forcing is a method of forcing decyrption by trying every possible key, or, in this case, a shift word for caeser's cipher. It is inefficient but virtually guaranteed to work given you try every possible word. That is why Caeser's cipher is considered weak, because if someone has the ciphertext, given enough time, they can decrypt it by brute-forcing the key.
## Conclusion
To conclude, we learned about how to use lucidchart, data transmission, how it is divied and how it works, including IP addresses, DNS servers and protocols, as well as the hardware required. We also dicussed the different network systems, their design, their flaws, and their securities. We talked about cybersecurity, methods of authentication, as well as permission management. Lastly, we explored cryptography, discussing ciphers as well as how encryption and decyrption work.
